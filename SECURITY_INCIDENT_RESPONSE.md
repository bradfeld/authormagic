# Security Incident Response - July 24, 2025

## üö® Incident Summary

**Date**: July 24, 2025 at 20:34 UTC  
**Type**: Exposed Supabase Service Role Keys  
**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED

### What Happened

During deployment of the Vercel UX integration feature, hardcoded Supabase service role keys were accidentally committed and pushed to the public GitHub repository. Both development and production database credentials were exposed.

### Detected By

- GitHub Secret Detection
- GitGuardian Security Alert

### Exposed Credentials

- **Development Environment**: `ehoqzlkjbcjfekiwhwpd.supabase.co`
- **Production Environment**: `soxcczdtgaxrgzehacth.supabase.co`

---

## üîß Resolution Actions Taken

### ‚úÖ 1. Immediate Remediation (COMPLETED)

**Fixed Scripts:**

- `scripts/cleanup-dev-legacy-tables.js`
- `scripts/migrate-production.js`
- `scripts/create-user-roles-table.js`
- `scripts/migrate-production-fixed.js`

**Changes Made:**

- Removed all hardcoded Supabase service keys
- Updated scripts to use environment variables
- Added proper error handling for missing environment variables
- Added dotenv dependency for environment variable loading

### ‚úÖ 2. Security Enhancements (COMPLETED)

**Enhanced .gitignore:**

- Added patterns to detect JWT tokens
- Added patterns for API keys and secrets
- Added patterns for database credentials
- Added backup file exclusions

**New Security Scripts:**

- `scripts/setup-secure-env.js` - Environment variable setup validation
- `scripts/detect-secrets.js` - Pre-commit secret detection
- Added npm scripts: `npm run security:setup` and `npm run security:scan`

### ‚ö†Ô∏è 3. Required Manual Actions

**YOU MUST DO THESE IMMEDIATELY:**

1. **Rotate Supabase Service Keys**
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí API
   - Click "Generate new service role key" for:
     - Development project (`ehoqzlkjbcjfekiwhwpd`)
     - Production project (`soxcczdtgaxrgzehacth`)
2. **Update Environment Variables**

   ```bash
   # Add to .env.local
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-new-service-role-key

   # For production scripts (optional)
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL_PRODUCTION=https://prod-project.supabase.co
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY_PRODUCTION=your-new-prod-service-role-key
   ```

3. **Validate Setup**
   ```bash
   npm run security:setup
   ```

## üõ°Ô∏è Prevention Measures Implemented

### Pre-commit Protection

```bash
# Run secret detection before committing
npm run security:scan
```

### Environment Validation

```bash
# Validate secure environment setup
npm run security:setup
```

### Enhanced .gitignore

- JWT token patterns blocked
- Service key patterns blocked
- API secret patterns blocked
- Database URL patterns blocked

## üìã Security Checklist

### Immediate Actions (Required)

- [ ] **Rotate Supabase service keys** (CRITICAL - DO FIRST)
- [ ] **Update .env.local with new keys**
- [ ] **Run `npm run security:setup` to validate**
- [ ] **Test database scripts with new keys**

### Ongoing Security (Recommended)

- [ ] **Run `npm run security:scan` before each commit**
- [ ] **Regularly rotate service keys (every 90 days)**
- [ ] **Review database access logs for suspicious activity**
- [ ] **Monitor security alerts from GitHub/GitGuardian**

## üîç Security Best Practices Going Forward

### For Developers

1. **Never hardcode secrets** in any file
2. **Always use environment variables** for sensitive data
3. **Run security scans** before committing
4. **Use different keys** for development and production
5. **Rotate keys regularly** and when team members leave

### For Database Scripts

1. **Use environment variables**: Scripts now load from `.env.local`
2. **Validate environment**: Run `npm run security:setup` first
3. **Separate environments**: Use different keys for dev/prod
4. **Error handling**: Scripts will fail safely if keys are missing

### For Repository Management

1. **Monitor security alerts** from GitHub and GitGuardian
2. **Review commits** for potential security issues
3. **Update .gitignore** patterns as needed
4. **Document incidents** for future reference
