# Bugbot Setup Guide for AuthorMagic

## 🐛 Overview

Bugbot is Cursor's AI Code Review tool that catches real bugs and security issues before they make it to production. This guide covers the setup and configuration specific to the AuthorMagic project.

## 📋 Configuration Summary

Our `.bugbot.yaml` configuration includes rules for:

### **Next.js 15 App Router**

- ✅ Server Components by default (avoid unnecessary `'use client'`)
- ✅ Proper metadata exports (`generateMetadata` vs static `metadata`)
- ✅ Viewport configuration (themeColor in `viewport` not `metadata`)
- ✅ Performance optimizations (dynamic imports, next/image usage)

### **TypeScript Safety**

- ✅ Strict typing (no `any` types)
- ✅ Supabase database type safety
- ✅ API response type definitions

### **Security Rules**

- 🔐 Clerk authentication validation in protected routes
- 🔐 API route protection and authentication middleware
- 🔐 Input sanitization and validation
- 🔐 SQL injection prevention

### **Supabase Best Practices**

- 🗄️ Proper client usage (server vs browser clients)
- 🗄️ Row Level Security (RLS) policy coverage
- 🗄️ Database error handling

### **AuthorMagic-Specific Checks**

- 📚 Author profile data validation
- 📚 Book data integrity (ISBN, title, author consistency)
- 📚 Waitlist security and validation

## 🚀 Setup Steps

### 1. Account Setup ✅

- [x] Signed up at [cursor.com/bugbot](https://cursor.com/bugbot)
- [x] Connected GitHub repository (authormagic.com)

### 2. Configuration ✅

- [x] Created `.bugbot.yaml` with AuthorMagic-specific rules
- [x] Configured tech stack detection (Next.js, TypeScript, Supabase, Clerk)

### 3. Testing Integration

Now we need to test that Bugbot is working correctly:

1. **Create a test branch**:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b test/bugbot-integration
   ```

2. **Make a small change** that would trigger a rule (e.g., add a component with potential issues)

3. **Open a Pull Request** to trigger Bugbot review

4. **Verify integration** - Bugbot should comment on the PR with findings

## 🔧 How It Works

### **Pull Request Flow**

1. **Push code** to a branch
2. **Open PR** → Bugbot automatically reviews
3. **Receive feedback** → Bugbot comments on specific lines
4. **Fix in Cursor** → Click "Fix in Cursor" buttons for automated fixes

### **Cursor IDE Integration**

- **Inline hints** appear while coding
- **Background agent** runs automatically
- **Fix suggestions** with one-click application

## 📊 Rule Categories & Severity

| Category               | Rules   | Severity      | Impact                   |
| ---------------------- | ------- | ------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Security**           | 6 rules | High/Critical | Blocks merge on critical |
| **TypeScript**         | 3 rules | High/Medium   | Type safety enforcement  |
| **Next.js**            | 5 rules | Medium/Low    | Best practices           |
| **Supabase**           | 3 rules | High/Medium   | Database safety          |
| **AuthorMagic Custom** | 3 rules | High/Medium   | Domain-specific          |

## 🎯 Expected Benefits

### **For AuthorMagic Specifically**

- **Book Data Quality**: Catch inconsistencies in ISBN, title, author data
- **Authentication Security**: Ensure all dashboard routes are protected
- **API Safety**: Validate all book/author API endpoints
- **Performance**: Optimize book search and data processing
- **Type Safety**: Prevent runtime errors in complex book data operations

### **Development Workflow**

- **Faster Reviews**: Automated catching of common issues
- **Consistent Standards**: Enforce coding patterns across the team
- **Learning Tool**: Learn best practices through AI feedback
- **Production Quality**: Catch bugs before deployment

## 🛠️ Customization

### **Adding New Rules**

Edit `.bugbot.yaml` to add project-specific rules:

```yaml
custom_checks:
  book_validation_rule:
    description: 'Ensure book ISBN validation follows industry standards'
    pattern: 'src/lib/services/book-validation.service.ts'
    severity: 'high'
```

### **Adjusting Severity**

Change rule severity in the configuration:

- `critical` - Blocks PR merge
- `high` - Requires attention
- `medium` - Recommended fixes
- `low` - Suggestions

## 📈 Monitoring & Analytics

### **Success Metrics**

- **Bug Detection Rate**: % of real bugs caught by Bugbot
- **False Positive Rate**: % of incorrect flagged issues
- **Resolution Rate**: % of Bugbot suggestions accepted/fixed
- **Time Saved**: Reduced manual code review time

### **Expected Outcomes**

Based on Cursor's data:

- **50%+ resolution rate** (issues that are actually fixed)
- **40% time savings** on code reviews
- **Early bug detection** preventing production issues

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. **Test the integration** with a sample PR
2. **Monitor effectiveness** over the next few PRs
3. **Adjust rules** based on false positives/negatives
4. **Train the team** on using Bugbot feedback effectively
